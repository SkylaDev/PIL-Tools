Release Notes
=============

As the Pillow library updates I plan to try keeping this module updated to work alongside it with no issues.

As well as this I also plan to update this module whenever I find problems with the code or when I get new
ideas/features to add.

It is advised that you always use the latest version of both this module and Pillow. As mentioned on the Pillow docs
functionality and security fixes should not be expected to be backported to earlier versions of both modules.
